# BadBank

## Description
This is a simulation banking app that includes the ability to create an account, log in, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and logout. I built this as an exercise in Javascript and React, but also to grow my ability to implement databases, authentication, and authorization.

## Installation Guidelines
- To get this project running locally start by forking the project to your own GitHub account, and then use the git clone command within a terminal to pull the files to your machine.
- Install all the necessary dependencies by subsequently running the npm install command in the frontend and root directory

## Technology Used
- Bootstrap for styles.
- React for a JS library and framework.
- Docker to run the database.
- Mongodb for a datase.
- CORS to indicate origins and add a level of security.
- Express.js to serve all of the static files of the application, to set up routes, and to communicate with the DAL.
- Node for a JavaScript runtime + Node package manager to install dependencies and other technologies.

## Features
This project in its current state can create and login users through a Mongo database. Near future implementations will include Firebase authentication and authorization, withdraw, deposit, view transactions, and logout functions.
